# Gif Generator

This is a Giphy App. 

This app allows users to view gifs of various topics. The user can click on any of the buttons provided to see gifs of that topic and if the user wants to see gifs of another topic, all he/she needs to do is type it in to the space provided and click submit. A new button will appear and the user can click on it to see more gifs! 

Users can get started with the app by simply clicking on the buttons and then clicking on the gif to watch it!

A challenge that I faced when coding this app was figuring out how to pull still images from Giphy API and then when the user clicks on the image, it switches to a gif. I was able to overcome this by creating functions; one for pulling images and another for animating them.
